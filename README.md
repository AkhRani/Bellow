# Bellow
This is intended to be a clone of the original Master Of Orion.  The goal is to be as close as possible to the original, but allow modifications (to races, AI, and tech tree for example) via scripts.  Even if this never gets close to completion, it will give me an excuse to mess around with technologies and techniques I don't get to use at work.

I'm not about to give detailed instructions to the approximately zero people who want to build this on their own.  I'm using gtest for the BellowTest project, and Lua for LuaConsole and (eventually) the full game.  Currently using VisualStudio 2013 to build the thing.
